# invalidate

`abstract fun invalidate(): `[`Unit`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-unit/index.html)

Make the view redraw itself. Triggered after all the information from the node was loaded into the View.
You probably do not need to override this as this is implemented by the `View` class itself.
