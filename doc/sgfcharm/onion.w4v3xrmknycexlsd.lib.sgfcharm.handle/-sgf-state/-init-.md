`SgfState()`

This class holds state relevant to the [GoSgfView](../../onion.w4v3xrmknycexlsd.lib.sgfcharm.view/-go-sgf-view/index.md).

Although I believe that this class is fairly generally applicable, I would not recommend using
it directly. Instead, the [SgfNodeHandler](../-sgf-node-handler/index.md) should define everything which is necessary to manipulate
this object.
